Cricket Game

This is a basic architecture for a chat service which will respond on certain commands and print out the game status for you.

A game mode of ‘PvE’ and 'PvP' has been made in the form of a match. 
The match lasts for an over. The user has to play every ball by writing a set of commands sent as chat messages. 1 batsman and 1 bowler ‘skill’ details will be provided. 
These skills determine the likelihood of an outcome of a played ball (basically a matchup prototype of that in Superstars).

In this I have implemented the PvP part of the game that is the 2 players play against each other.
fisrt the player 1 plays the game and sets the target score and the seconf player bowls first and according to yhe probability the score is provided to the players.
after that in the seconf inning the second player bats and chases the target score and result is been shown.
I have coded the above game using the C++ programminf language and have tried to implement as many steps as possible.
